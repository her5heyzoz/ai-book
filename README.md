This project is a web crawler tool developed using the Selenium library, specifically designed to extract information about artificial intelligence (AI) textbooks from Douban Books (www.douban.com) and perform word frequency statistical analysis.

Key Features

Data Acquisition

Employs Selenium to simulate browser interactions and automate the scraping of textbook metadata (titles, descriptions, reviews) within the AI domain from Douban Books.

Implements intelligent pagination handling and anti-crawler countermeasures.

Text Processing

Executes comprehensive text preprocessing including noise removal, tokenization, and stopword filtering.

Performs TF-IDF weighted frequency analysis to identify domain-specific keywords and terminologies.

Analytics Visualization

Generates interactive visualizations (word clouds, frequency histograms) for intuitive pattern recognition.

Exports structured datasets (CSV/JSON) and statistical reports for further analysis.
